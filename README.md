# 7drl-2026

This is my entry for [7DRL Challenge 2026](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2026). It is my first time participating in 7DRL although I've known about the event for a long time.

## Goals

Because this is my first time participating, my intention is to put together a fairly minimal, vanilla Rogue-like. I'm using TypeScript + HTML canvas so that the result will be easily playable in a browser without users needing to install anything or run untrusted binary executables.
